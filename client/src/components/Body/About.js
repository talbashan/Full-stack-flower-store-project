                        <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>Tali's Flower was established in 1987, shortly after the peace agreement between the Homegardners and the people of Purpleton was made. Ever since, Tail's flower provides fresh and luxurious purple flowers worldwide (mostly around Jeruslaem…).
                            Our flowers are exquisitely purple, specially grown by the people of Purplton (who really need the money, may we say… you are basically doing charity when buying from us), harvested and packaged with care. We provide both real-life and online flowers on demand, and thanks to our great shipping team, you can order our wonderfully purple flowers strait to your house and/or Email…</p>
